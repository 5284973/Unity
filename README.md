#####Updates
Life has been keeping me quite busy these days and I have found myself with less and less free time to work on the Unity pack with each passing day. To solve that problem, I have opened a repo for anyone to contribute to (thanks to VapourDrive for the idea).

Not all submitted textures will be merged. If I feel your textures do not fit with my current design aesthetic, I simply can't include them. The entire point of Unity is to maintain a unified look. Please do not feel discouraged if your textures aren't used; it doesn't mean they're bad, they just don't match my style.

Please note that not all textures have been updated for 1.7.10 nor have they been updated for their latest mod versions. I will be adding version notes shortly to hopefully keep things organized.

#####Mods In Progress
The following chart displays current mod retexture progress. 
Avoid retexturing these as it will probably be a waste of time. ;)
